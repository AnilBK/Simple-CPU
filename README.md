## A Small CPU design experiment.

The CPU circuit is itself designed in Digital. <https://github.com/hneemann/Digital>

The compiler is written in Python,which exports the final binary in hexes.
The writing of hexes is done by IntelHex python library.

Files:                        Description

- code_generator.py           The original compiler.
- code_generator_v2.py        The original compiler modified with some OOP approach._It introduces the following files._
  * register.py               Software implementation of hardware register.
  * constants.py              Constants required for the new compiler.

**However both compilers above produce same binary.
V2 compiler(code_generator_v2) introduces the above two files,while V1 compiler is a single file implementation.**

- custom_code.txt             This is where our programs are written.

- code.hex                    This is the final file generated by compiler,which contains the instructions for CPU to execute.
- data.hex                    This is the another final file used by the CPU. This contains additional operands required for the main instructions.

- CPU_With_Registers.dig      The main CPU circuit.This file is opened with Digital.

  Intermediate Files.  
- simplified_code.txt         The first pass of compiler output.
- generated_code.txt          The final pass of compiler output.This file is then written as hexes.
